# How to play
We try to follow original rules of advanced dungeon and dragons second edition.

## General terminology

### Once per day

When we say `once per day` that actually mean once before rest. After party rest all spells and abilities refreshes.

## Exeptions

- **Percent saving throws**: repsresent percent visualisation of saving throws instead of chance on d20 dice. All mechanics have original values but representation is percent. So `20` on d20 is 5% success, `19+` on d20 is 10% success and so on.
- **Deflect critial**: when occurs critical hit this is chance to evade doubled (or tripled) damage.
- **Detect secrets door**: when passed by secret button character has chance to notify button on wall.
