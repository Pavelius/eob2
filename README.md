# Purpose
Creating new unique engine to play in AD&D on PC.

# How to play
We try to follow original rules of advanced dungeon and dragons second edition.

## General terminology

### Once per day

When we say `once per day` that actually mean once before rest. After party rest all spells and abilities refreshes.

## Classes
Each character in game have one or more classes. All classes follow rules of AD&D 2 edition. With several exeptions.

### Paladin
Brave and honesty knight.

- All saving throws have `+2` bonus (or +10%).
- Have immune to any known disease.
- Can detect evil sences or motives once per day, casting `Detect Evil` spell.
- Can cast `Cure Disease` spell once per day.
- Beginning with 3rd level can cast `Turn undead` twice per day as cleric of 1st level. So turning undead copy cleric ability on two level lower, as mentioned in original AD&D rules.
- Party members can't lie in presence of paladin and must be honest.

## Exeptions

- **Percent saving throws**: repsresent percent visualisation of saving throws instead of chance on d20 dice. All mechanics have original values but representation is percent. So `20` on d20 is 5% success, `19+` on d20 is 10% success and so on.
- **Deflect critial**: when occurs critical hit this is chance to evade doubled (or tripled) damage.
- **Detect secrets door**: when passed by secret button character has chance to notify button on wall.
